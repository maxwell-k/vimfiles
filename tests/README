# Introduction

This folder contains tests for vim written using both `runVimTests` and `vader`.
`vader` is installed as a git sub-module. To run both sets of tests on Alpine
Linux use `make test`.

# Vader usage

- Run inside vim: `:packadd vader | Vader %`
- Run from command line: `vim '+packadd vader | Vader! index.vader'`
- Run all tests: `sh run.sh`

Examples are in `/usr/share/vim/vimfiles/pack/ac/opt/vader/test/vader.vader`

# Vader authoring notes

- Avoid Before and After because the can impact on included files
- Move buffers with `:buffer` in an Execute block
