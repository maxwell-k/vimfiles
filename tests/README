Introduction
============

This folder contains tests for vim written using both `runVimTests` and
`vader`. ``vim/site.yaml`` installs `vader` and the first command
below installs `runVimTests`. To run both sets of tests use `make _test`.

Vader usage
===========

Run inside vim: ``:packadd vader | Vader %``
Run from command line: ``vim '+packadd vader | Vader! index.vader'``
Run all tests: ``sh run.sh``

Examples are in ``/usr/share/vim/vimfiles/pack/ac/opt/vader/test/vader.vader``

Vader authoring notes
=====================

-   Avoid Before and After because the can impact on included files
-   Move buffers with `:buffer` in an Execute block

.. vim: filetype=rst
