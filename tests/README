Introduction
============

This folder contains tests for vim written using both `runVimTests` and
`vader`. ``playbooks/vim.yaml`` installs `vader` and the first command
below installs `runVimTests`. To run both sets of tests use the second command
below:

.. code:: sh

    sudo apk -X https://aports.keithmaxwell.uk/user add runVimTests
    sh run.sh

Vader usage
===========

Run inside vim: ``:packadd vader | Vader %``
Run from command line: ``vim '+packadd vader | Vader! index.vader'``
Run all tests: ``sh run.sh``

Examples are in ``/usr/share/vim/vimfiles/pack/ac/opt/vader/test/vader.vader``

Authoring notes
===============

-   Avoid Before and After because the can impact on included files
-   Yank vim script and execute with ``:@"``.
-   Move windows from a Do block with ``\<c-w>j`` see
    `pack/tests/opt/vader/autoload/vader/window.vim:115`
-   Be very careful with Before blocks in test scripts called from
    `index.vader`

.. vim: filetype=rst
