# Introduction

This folder contains tests for vim. Some are written using `vader`. `vader` is
installed as a git sub-module. To run all of these use `./run.sh`.

Some tests will require `pipx` or `npm` to pass. Isolation between tests is
achieved by re-starting vim.

The layout uses a directory for `automated` tests so that it is easy to add a
manual test separately. It is better to have a manual test than no test.

## Vader

### Usage

- Run inside vim: `:packadd vader | Vader %`
- Run from command line: `vim '+packadd vader | Vader! index.vader'`
- Run all tests: `sh run.sh`

Examples are in `pack/submodules/opt/vader/test/vader.vader`

### Authoring notes

- Avoid Before and After because the can impact on included files
- Move buffers with `:buffer` in an Execute block

## Structure

Each set of automated tests is laid out in a directory under `./automated`.

`run.sh` in each directory will run the tests.
