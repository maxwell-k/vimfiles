# .vim

## Quick start

Clone this repository and its sub-modules as `~/.vim`:

    git clone --recurse-submodules <url>/vimfiles ~/.vim

Update the help files and download a few scripts:

    ansible-playbook -i, site.yaml

Test the configuration:

    tests/run.sh

Set up pre-commit hooks:

    git config core.hooksPath $PWD/hooks

Regularly tested on Alpine Linux and Mac OS. Infrequently tested on Debian and
Ubuntu.

Test inside a Linux container:

    tests/podman.sh

## Contents

This repository contains about 1,300 lines of vim script accumulated since 2012.
Much of it will not be of interest to anyone but the original author; a few
"features" may be:

- Complete syntax files for SQLite and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)
  written from scratch.
- A plugin for interacting with a https://jupyter.org kernel inspired by
  https://github.com/ivanov/vim-ipython
- A file type plugin for automatically committing to Git
- A few extra linters and fixers for https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale

## Decisions

1. Testable in Linux containers
2. Ansible playbook that does not use admin privileges
3. Name the repository `vimfiles`

### Testable in Linux containers manually

There are additional costs — time and resource — to setting up a continuous
integration (CI) system. Codeberg, the solution I've chosen for git hosting,
does not have a preferred CI system, [only a beta] for Woodpecker. There's a
risk I'll implement one system and then, later I will need to implement another.
Configuring a CI system is not time well spent right now. Today the costs or
running CI outweigh the benefits.

[only a beta]: https://codeberg.org/Codeberg/Community/issues/78

Regularly running tests manually inside a Linux container ensures that tests
pass on a fresh system install.

### Ansible playbook that does not use admin privileges

_A limited amount of user-specific configuration is in scope for this
repository, so that it is more valuable independently._

It is helpful to store some configuration tasks, for example generating help
tags, alongside the vim script. I prefer to use Ansible for configuration.

No configuration tasks stored in this repository should use administrator
privileges. System configuration is out of scope for this repository.

### Name the repository `vimfiles`

Vim help uses `vimfiles` as an alternative to `.vim`, see `:help vimfiles`. The
string `dotvim` does is only incidentally mentioned in `:help`.

There's a comparable number of repositories on GitHub called `dotvim` and
`vimfiles`. More are called `dotvim`, but better known authors use `vimfiles`.

Overall I prefer the name `vimfiles`.

## Git configuration

This repository uses approximately twenty git sub-modules. It may be helpful to
set `git config diff.ignoreSubmodules dirty` so that `git status` completes
quickly.

## Removed sub-modules

The following plugins are not currently in use:

## `opt/jedi`

- https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim
- switched to pyright via ALE

### `opt/gnupg`

- https://github.com/jamessan/vim-gnupg

### `start/fzf`

- https://github.com/junegunn/fzf
- 0.17.5
- only required on Debian and Ubuntu, as system packages aren't available

### `start/rust`

- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.vim

### `start/racer` for rust

- https://github.com/racer-rust/vim-racer
- needs `cc`, so install build-essential on Ubuntu or Debian

### `opt/jsx`

- https://github.com/MaxMEllon/vim-jsx-pretty/
- `v3.0.0`

### `opt/mdx`

- https://github.com/jxnblk/vim-mdx-js/
- clear settings from `ftplugin/markdown.vim`
