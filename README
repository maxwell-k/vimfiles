# .vim

## Quick start

Clone this repository and its sub-modules as `~/.vim`

Regularly tested on Alpine Linux and Mac OS. Infrequently tested on Debian and
Ubuntu.

## Contents

This repository contains about 1,000 lines of vim script accumulated since 2012.
Much of it will not be of interest to anyone but the original author; a few
"features" may be:

- Complete syntax files for SQLite and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)
  written from scratch.
- A plugin for interacting with a https://jupyter.org kernel inspired by
  https://github.com/ivanov/vim-ipython
- A file type plugin for automatically committing to Git
- A few extra linters or fixers for https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale

## System packages

As well as installing vim, `site.yaml` will install the system packages below:

## Git configuration

This repository uses approximately twenty git sub-modules. It may be helpful to
set `git config diff.ignoreSubmodules dirty` so that `git status` completes
quickly.

## Removed sub-modules

The following plugins are not currently in use:

### `start/fzf`

- https://github.com/junegunn/fzf
- 0.17.5
- only required on Debian and Ubuntu, as system packages aren't available

### `start/rust`

- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.vim

### `start/racer` for rust

- https://github.com/racer-rust/vim-racer
- needs `cc`, so install build-essential on Ubuntu or Debian

### `opt/jsx`

- https://github.com/MaxMEllon/vim-jsx-pretty/
- `v3.0.0`

### `opt/mdx`

- https://github.com/jxnblk/vim-mdx-js/
- clear settings from `ftplugin/markdown.vim`
